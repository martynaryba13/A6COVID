Achievement 6 COVID-19 Prevalence in the United States
## Objective
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The pandemic has affected people across the world in many ways for the past 2.5 years. In this analysis, we will explore the spread of COVID-19 across the United States as well as the effect of vaccines.
The following questions will be investigated:
- How are COVID-19 cases and deaths distributed over the United States?
- How do vaccines impact COVID-19 cases?
- How do vaccines impact deaths from COVID-19?
- How do vaccines effect hospitalizations?
